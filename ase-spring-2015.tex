\section{Introduction}

A common form of observational bias is called the ``streetlight effect'', named in honor of the
following joke:

\begin{quotation}
{\em A drunk loses the keys to his house and is looking for them under a streetlight. A policeman
comes over and asks what he's doing. ``I'm looking for my keys'' he says. ``I lost them over there''.
The policeman looks puzzled. ``Then why are you looking for them all the way over here?''
``Because the light is so much better''.}
